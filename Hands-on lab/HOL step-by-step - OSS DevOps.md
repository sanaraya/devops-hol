## Exercise 1: Deploy the Web Application and Database to Azure

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will deploy the web application and database to Azure using Azure App Service and Azure Database for MySQL. The first steps will be to build the MySQL DB and then import the data using MySQL Workbench. Then, you will create the Azure Web App and connect it to GitHub to download the app using a Docker Container with PHP 7.0.

### Task 1: Create the MySQL database

1.  From the Azure portal, select on the Cloud Shell icon on the top navigation. Select Bash and mount a storage account if you already haven't done so.

    ![Screenshot of the Launch Cloud shell icon.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image17.png "Launch Cloud shell icon")

2.  Execute the following command to create a resource group to contain the MySQL DB:

    ```
    az group create --name OsTicketPaaSRG --location "East US"
    ```

3.  Execute the following command to create a MySQL Database:

    >**Note**: You must choose a unique name for the MySQL server. Replace **osticketsrv01** with a more unique value.

    ```
    az mysql server create --resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG --name osticketsrv01 --location "East US" --admin-user demouser --admin-password demo@pass123 --sku-name B_Gen5_2 --storage-size 51200 --ssl-enforcement Disabled
    ```
    
4.  Add an open firewall rule to the database by executing the following command. Ensure you replace the server name with the unique value from the previous step.
    
    ```
    az mysql server firewall-rule create --resource-group OsTicketPaaSRG --server-name osticketsrv01 --name Internet --start-ip-address 0.0.0.0 --end-ip-address 255.255.255.255
    ```
5.  Once the MySQL database has been deployed, locate and open it from the **OsTicketPaaSRG** resource group using the Azure Portal.

6.  Choose **Connection Strings**.

    ![Screenshot of the default App Service deployment.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image60.png "Default app service page")

### Summary

In this exercise, you used several Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) components to configure a Web Application. The Web App will use Azure Storage as well as MySQL for data. You also configured a staging slot for the Web Application with duplicate settings. The actual deployment of the Web Application will happen in an upcoming exercise.

## Exercise 2: Configure local Git repository

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will use the forked GitHub repository from the previous exercise and clone it locally so that you can configure your web app.

### Task 1: Clone a GitHub repository locally

1.  Browse to <https://github.com/>, and login with your GitHub credentials.

2.  Navigate to the **osTicket** repository that you forked in the previous exercise.

3.  Clone the site locally on your computer for future changes by executing the commands and starting a console/terminal session containing the Git client.

    ```
    mkdir repos

    cd repos

    git clone https://github.com/[**YOUR_GITHUB**_**USERNAME**]/osTicket
    ```

### Summary

In this exercise, you forked a GitHub repository and cloned it locally, so you can configure your web app.

## Exercise 3: Configure Git and Jenkins for continuous integration, delivery and deployment

Duration: 90 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure a Jenkins server in Azure and leverage it along with Git to setup continuous integration & delivery of your Web Application. You will be pulling source code from a GitHub repository and configuring Jenkins to build and deploy the code to your Staging slot before it is pushed to production (manually).

### Task 1: Deploy a Jenkins server in Azure

Jenkins is an open source continuous integration tool written in Java. It provides continuous integration services for software development. It is a server-based system running in a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. In this exercise, you will deploy a Jenkins Server in Azure leveraging a prebuilt virtual machine image from the Azure marketplace.

1.  If you are leveraging a virtual machine in Azure as your lab machine, first connect to it via RDP Otherwise to deploy a Jenkins Server instance in Azure, browse to <https://portal.azure.com>. Choose **+Create a resource**, type **Jenkins** in the search box, and hit **Enter**.

    ![In the Azure Portal, Create a resource is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image61.png "Azure Portal")

2.  You will notice that there are numerous preconfigured Jenkins servers available in the marketplace, for the purposes of the labs, choose the one submitted by **Microsoft** and select **Create**.

    ![In the Everything blade, Jenkins is selected under Results.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image62.png "Everything blade")

    ![The Deploying Jenkins image displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image66.png "Deploying Jenkins image")

### Task 2: Post-deployment configuration of the Jenkins server

Go to the Overview page of the Jenkins VM, copy the DNS name, and open the URL in the browser (for example, [http://osTicketjenkins.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/](http://osticketjenkins.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/)). The Jenkins console is inaccessible through unsecured HTTP so instructions are provided on the page to access the Jenkins console securely from your computer using an SSH tunnel. After that, you will update the OS and Jenkins to the latest as well as install other tools needed for our scenario.

1.  Using the FQDN you defined in the previous exercise, browse to your Jenkins portal.

    ![The Jenkins on Azure Log In window displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image67.png "Jenkins on Azure Log In window")

2.  Set up the tunnel by opening a PowerShell command prompt on your local computer and copying the ssh command on the browser page from the command line replacing username with the name of the virtual machine admin user chosen earlier.

    ```
    ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 demouser@{yourvmname}.{yourvmregion}.cloudapp.azure.com
    ```

3.  When prompted, enter the password you previously chose. Keep the command line window open.

4.  Get the initial password needed for the next step by running the following command in the command line while still connected through SSH:

    ```
    sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
5.  Copy the password shown to your clipboard, as you will need it to initially login to the Jenkins interface.

6.  Open a web browser, and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/> on your local machine. If a **Getting Started** window is presented, choose the **X** in the top of the screen to close it. Then, select the **Start using Jenkins** button.

    ![Screenshot of Developer settings menu.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image111.png "Personal access tokens")

4.  On the **New personal access token** screen, enter a name such as **Jenkins Builds** in the **Token description field** and be sure to check the box for **admin:org_hook** under the **Selected scopes** section. 

    ![Screenshot of Personal access tokens page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image112.png "Personal access tokens page")

5.  Then click the **Generate token** button at the bottom of the page to complete the token generation process.

6.  The page will refresh, and your new Personal access token will be displayed near the top. Be sure to copy this token (yours will be different) and paste it into a notepad for later use as you will not be able to retrieve it from GitHub once you leave this page.

    ![Screenshot of the new Personal access token.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image113.png "New Personal access token")

### Task 5: Configure your GitHub repo to notify Jenkins of changes

You will now configure your GitHub repository to notify your Jenkins server when a change has occurred, so the Jenkins Job is kicked off automatically.

1.  Log into your GitHub repo ([https://github.com/\<username\>/osTicket](https://github.com/%3cusername%3e/osticket)), and choose **Settings** followed by **Webhooks**.

    ![Screenshot of GitHub repository Settings showing where Webhooks menu option is located.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image97.png "Gitub settings")

2.  Select **Add webhook**, and set the following fields:

    - **Payload URL** - This is the URL to your Jenkins environment appended with **/github-webhook/**. For example: **http://jenkins99.southcentralus.cloudapp.azure.com/github-webhook/**

        >**Note the trailing slash (/)** -- make sure it is included in your URL:

    - **Content type** - Set this value to **application/json**.

    - **Secret** - Paste your Personal access token that you saved from the previous task.

    ![Add webhook page.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image98.png "Add webhook")

3.  Finally, click the **Add webhook** button to finalize the creation of the new webhook.
  
4.  The page will refresh, and if we've done everything correctly, you'll see a confirmation that the webhook tested successfully as indicated by the green checkmark.

    ![Successful webhook confirmation.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image114.png "Successful webhook confirmation")

### Task 6: Check in a change to trigger Jenkins job

You will now check in a change to your Web Application code that will trigger your Jenkins job by editing the file that updates the home page.

1.  Open the following file in an editor such as Visual Studio Code **osTicket\\include\\client \\footer.inc.php**.

2.  Choose Ctrl+F, and find the following HTML code:

    ```
    All rights reserved.</p>
    ```

3.  Make a modification to the text and select FileSave.

    ```
    All rights reserved. Run on Azure App Services!</p>
    ```

4.  Move to a **Git Shell**, and execute the following git commands from the directory where the repo resides to push the update to your repository in GitHub.

    ```
    git config user.name "Your Name"

    git config user.email "your@email.com"

    git add -A

    git commit -m "updated model"

    git push
    ```

>**Note**: You may be required to authenticate using your github.com username and password.

5.  Now that a change has been checked in, there are various places to check that the process has worked. Start by checking that the staging website has been updated. 

>**Note**: The deployment will take a few moments.

   ![Screenshot showing the updated homepage with the edited content.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image100.png "Support center home page")

6.  You can also check logs in Jenkins. From the home page of your Jenkins portal, select the drop-down of your Jenkins job, and choose **GitHub Hook Log**.

    ![On the Jenkins portal homepage, the URL for the page is selected. In addition, Deploy to Staging is selected, and from its drop-down menu, GitHub Hook Log is selected. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image101.png "Jenkins portal homepage")

7.  You can also check the Build History log and Console Output of the Jenkins project.

    ![On the Jenkins portal homepage, Build History displays.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image102.png "Jenkins portal homepage")

### Task 7: Manually deploy to production

Up to this point, you have automated the integration and delivery to your staging slot. You will now move those changes into the production slot *manually*. Leveraging the tools you have configured so far, you could ultimately automate this last step to get continuous deployment.

1.  To push the changes from your staging slot to production, in the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>), select **Resource groups \> OsTicketPaaSRG** and then select your App Service.

    ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to the app service.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image103.png "Choosing the web app")

2.  Select **Swap** at the top of the screen.

    ![Screenshot showing how to navigate to swap the deployment slots](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image104.png "Swapping the web app")

3.  Be sure that **Staging** is listed as the **Source** and **production** as the **Destination**, and choose **OK**.

    ![The previous fields are set to the previous settings in the Swap blade.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image105.png "Swap blade")

4.  Once the Swap has completed, verify the changes have been pushed to your production slot by browsing to your production URL.

    ![Screenshot of the production url version of the website.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-OSSDevOpsimages/media/image106.png "Production url")

### Summary

In this exercise, you leveraged Azure, Jenkins and GitHub to setup continuous integration, delivery, and deployment for your web site. You built a scenario where your code changes were automatically pushed out to a staging slot after collecting assets from GitHub.

## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 10 minutes

### Task 1: Delete Resources

1.  Now that the Hands-on lab is complete, go ahead and delete all the Resource Groups that were created for this lab. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
