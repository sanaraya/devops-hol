# DevOps Hands-On

## The content of this workshop has been tailored to cover a few scenarios and may not be a complete workshop on DevOps. Content is read-only.

Trey Research is an online vitamins seller that has a presence mainly in the United Kingdom and other countries/regions in Europe. They want to expand into other parts of the world starting with Asia and will soon be setting up distribution centers for their vitamins there. They have no retail stores; thus, all their business comes through their website. SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is extremely important to them as is their user website experience with a heavy focus on availability and performance.

The company currently has two application teams: **Development** for their websites, and **Operations** for deployments and backend servers. These are all hosted in a commercial data center. The teams have a great deal of experience in developing applications in PHP and WordPress for the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). What they lack is the operational expertise and maturity to maintain their applications properly. They struggle with development and design practices, deployments, configuration management, and scaling their application to meet busy seasonal periods.
